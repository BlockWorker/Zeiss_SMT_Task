This repository contains Alexander Kharitonov's solution for an implementation task given by Zeiss SMT recruitment.

The C and C++ implementations of the task are contained in the `Embedded_Task_C` and `Embedded_Task_CPP` directories, respectively, each containing an STM32CubeIDE project targetting the hardware described below.

In each project, all task-relevant application code is contained in the `App` subdirectory. All other subdirectories contain hardware-specific driver, startup, and initialisation code, the majority of which is automatically generated by the IDE.

## Architecture

The software architecture of the C++ implementation is described in the UML diagram below.

The BSP (Board Support Package) class acts as an abstraction between the software implementation and the hardware-specific interface. In its current state, its implementation is tailored for the real hardware described below.

The specified temperature sample timing ("every 100Î¼s, with very low jitter") is not handled by the application code itself. Instead, a hardware timer is configured to trigger the ADC directly at a frequency of 10 kHz (derived from the main system clock).

The C implementation follows the same architectural principle (just split into files, instead of classes). The corresponding functions and variables are either global or file-local.
Due to the lack of OOP features (specifically, inheritance), the separation between different hardware revisions is handled by a simple `switch` in the common temperature sensor code.

Both implementations support the hardware revisions _A_ and _B_, as defined in the specification. These assume a linear voltage-temperature relationship.

Additionally, there is support for a new hardware revision _C_, which matches the real hardware implementation described below.
Due to the use of a non-linear temperature sensing circuit (voltage divider with an NTC thermistor), a matching non-linear conversion function is implemented for this revision (using Steinhart-Hart temperature approximation).

## Hardware implementation

The following conceptual schematic describes the hardware implementation targetted by the code in this repository (_Revision C_).

The setup consists of an STM32 Nucleo development board, a prototyping board, and an off-the-shelf module for the EEPROM, as shown below.
